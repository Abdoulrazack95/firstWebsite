         <h1> Djibouti the crossroad of three continents </h1>
          <h2>A travel guide to Djibouti</h2>
          <p>Covering an area of ​​approximately 23,200 km2, Djibouti is located in the part of Africa called the Horn of Africa, precisely on the west side of the southern outlet of the Red Sea. 
            Former French colony, Djibouti is now a free and independent country. Small landlocked state between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, Djibouti rejoiced to its opening on the Red Sea. 
            At the crossroads of three continents, Djibouti has long been a commercial and cultural crossroads. However Djibouti is above all breathtaking landscapes. Volcanoes, salt floes, 
            rock deserts, exceptional seabed, sandy beaches ... The meeting place for tectonic plates from the Middle East and Africa boiling with life and color.</p>
